So it occurred to me on my quest to share data that some people, including me, would like to be able to see what the data looks like without having to download it. I thought about the long and arduous process of cutting and pasting small samples from the csv files into the markdown. When I thought about what a pita it would be I decided to not do it. Then today as I was working on my next data set to share, VIVO grants by year with total award dollar amounts, I decided I wanted to look at the csv output in google docs. So I uploaded the grants csv to google sheets and started playing with it. You can see where this is going right, well I didn't until today 'cause I am a little slow sometimes. So I thought, maybe people would like to be able to link directly to the Github raw output and now I have, count 'em, two ways to visualize data in your browser. So from now on, as much as possible, I will endeavor to give you the google docs and github links to the files so you can just click on them and enjoy the data via your browser before you decide to download.

Enjoy!

PS: you can get the SPARQL query I used and download all this data as JSON, RDF or CSV right [here](http://senrabc.github.io/vivo/2015/09/17/All-University-Of-Florida-Papers-Published-Given-Year.html)
